					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">Pierre was born in the city of Paris and pursued a higher education earning a master's degree from the prestigious universities Paris VI and Paris VII. His academic focus was on physics, microelectronics, and micro computing, showcasing his innate talent for complex technical subjects.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">Pierre's career journey began with a deep dive into the world of microelectronics, where he initially worked as an engineer specializing in CAD software development for IC chips. This early experience laid the foundation for a successful career pivot, transitioning from hardware to software within a renowned French company, "Bull." He was tasked with working on a significant project involving mainframe computers, a role that would ultimately set the stage for his international adventures.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">Intrigued by the opportunity to train engineers in the United States at a design center for Bull in Phoenix, Arizona, Pierre embarked on a transformative journey across the Atlantic. His expertise in software design for microelectronics proved invaluable in this new chapter of his career.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">Pierre's professional journey led him to join other prominent companies such as " Dassault Electronique" (acquired by Thales) and "Cadence Design Systems." Notably, at Cadence, he played a pivotal role in revolutionizing the company's business model by introducing consulting services alongside their software offerings. This endeavor led to remarkable growth, starting with a team of 11 to more than 1,500 consultants worldwide.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">After an illustrious tenure at Cadence, Pierre embraced a new challenge, transitioning to "Documentum," a company specializing in electronic document management. His role expanded to encompass both consulting services and facilitating the implementation of software solutions for clients.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">As the technology landscape evolved, Pierre recognized the potential of entrepreneurship and ventured into the world of startups. He joined a French startup incubator, where he played a crucial role in selecting and nurturing promising startups. One of these ventures led to his role as a business developer and CTO, eventually culminating in his appointment as CEO.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">His entrepreneurial spirit remained unquenched, and Pierre embarked on another journey, leading to the merger of two French companies in the cybersecurity domain. The successful merger resulted in the formation of "Stormshield," where Pierre served as CEO. Overcoming the challenge of uniting two former competitors, he spearheaded the integration efforts and launched innovative product lines within a remarkably short timeframe.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">In 2018, Pierre's career path led him to "Qualys," a renowned cybersecurity company, where he assumed the role of French and EMEA Vice President. Subsequently, he joined the cybersecurity startup "Egerie," where he focuses on business development and international expansion.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">Beyond his impressive career, Pierre is an active member of the French American Foundation, serving on the steering committee of the cybersecurity college. He participates in forums and conferences that promote collaboration between the United States and France, particularly in the field of cybersecurity.</p1>
					<p1 id="bottom_con_content">In his personal life, Pierre is a passionate enthusiast of sports cars and enjoys owning a 68 Chevrolet Corvette. He also maintains an active lifestyle through activities such as running and holds a black belt in karate. Pierre is a dedicated family man, married with two children, and resides in the vicinity of Versailles, France.</p1>
